# spring-boot-jsp

This is an initial Spring Boot template that runs with jsp files as view. It was created using Spring Initializr. The project works correctly. The most important about this project is that I did not use any xml file for the bean creations. There is only one xml file and it is used by Maven. MySQL connector is used for the database connection. JPA module is included but there is no sample in the project. Spring Security module is included. You can disable it if you do not want to use.
